Project Name: AI-Powered Text Summarization

📌 Overview

This project focuses on AI-powered text summarization using Hugging Face's Transformers. The model processes long-form text and generates concise summaries while preserving key information. It is useful for applications like news summarization, research paper compression, and customer feedback analysis.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.12.4

Hugging Face Transformers (BART, T5, or similar models)

PyTorch

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook (for development)

🚀 Features

Accepts long text inputs and generates meaningful summaries.

Uses pretrained transformer models like BART/T5 for summarization.

Supports beam search, length penalty, and early stopping for better text quality.

Can process text from files, user input, or APIs.

Easily configurable parameters for fine-tuning summary length and style.

📥 Installation

To run this project locally, install the required dependencies:

pip install transformers torch

📌 Usage

1️⃣ Load the Model & Tokenizer

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

model_name = "facebook/bart-large-cnn"  # Choose the model

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

2️⃣ Summarize Text

text = """Your input text here. The model will generate a summary based on this input."""

inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding="longest")
summary_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=150, min_length=40, num_beams=4)
summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Generated Summary:", summary)

🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

Ensure the model is correctly loaded.

Use longer input texts for better summarization.

Adjust hyperparameters like num_beams, max_length, and repetition_penalty.
